For the last 5 years I've been a part of StormID, a digital transformation agency based in Leith, Edinburgh. For 4 years before that I was a part of a number of design agencies big and small, and even a small charity. My experience is broad, but more recently covers public sector projects, digital healthcare applications, and design systems.</p><p>My work always values simplicity, usability and accessibility. I question almost everything, and I don't like to follow trends. I ask questions and try to get to the heart of the problem I'm trying to solve. Most of all I'm open-minded. </p><p>My experience is predominently in UI, but I place huge importance on being involved at all stages of the design process, especially research. I write HTML and CSS, and occasionally JS where necessary. Writing frontend code for design is controversial but beneficial in my opinion. It allows me to think in terms of reusable components, directly influence the accessibility aspects of a project, make fixes to production code where needed, and speak the same language as frontend and backend developers.</p><p>For early ideation I use a pen and paper. Alongside coding I use the likes of XD and Figma to create rapid high-fidelity prototypes to engage the client, test with users, and iterate quickly. </p><p>More work examples are available on request.</p></div><div class="modal__content-block"><h2>I've designed for:</h2><ul class="list--blocked"><li>Historic Environment Scotland</li><li>Edinburgh Castle</li><li>Glasgow Life</li><li>Abrdn</li><li>Tikkurila</li><li>Youth Scotland</li><li>Young Scot</li><li>Historic England</li><li>Celtic Connections</li><li>Scottish Courts and Tribunals</li><li>NHS Scotland</li><li>Scottish Housing Regulator</li><li>Drinking Water Quality Regulator</li><li>Harrison Stevens</li><li>Natwest</li><li>Menzies Distribution</li><li>Edinburgh Fringe</li><li>Visit Scotland</li><li>The Scottish Government</li><li>Wood Mackenzie</li><li>Project Scotand</li><li>Scottish Enterprise</li><li>Northlink Ferries</li><li>Hemp Eyewear</li><li>Hemp MVMNT</li><li>and many more...</li></ul></div><div class="modal__content-block"><h2>I've studied:</h2><ul class="list--lined"><li>edX - Introduction to Web Accessibility</li><li>Udacity - Web Accessibility by Google</li><li>Codecademy - Introduction to HTML, CSS and JS</li><li>Glasgow Caledonian University - BA Hons Graphic Design for Digital Media</li><li>City of Glasgow College - HND Design and Visual Communication</li></ul></div></div></div><button role="button" aria-label="close" tabindex="0" class="modal__close-btn js-modal-toggler-1"><svg fill="#000" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12z"></path><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></header><div class="skip"><a class="skip__btn" href="#main">Skip to main content</a></div><main class="main" id="main"><div class="canvas"><div><div class="project-hero"><div class="project-hero__container"><div class="project-hero__content"><h1 class="project-hero__heading">Tikkurila</h1><div class="project-hero__detail"><div class="project-hero__description"><p>A revised e-commerce site to help break into a new market.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2>Who are Tikkurila?</h2><p>Tikkurila are an established paint brand in their home country of Finland. Whilst they have a presence in the UK, it is almost entirely made up of tradespeople. </p><p>We were approached to help them pivot towards DIY customers in the UK, without completely abandoning their existing professional customer base.</p><h2>Our task</h2><p>We would redesign key parts of their e-commerce site to better cater for DIY customers, and hand off to a separate team to handle the build. I had the following limitations from the start:</p><ul><li>The checkout experience was out of scope</li><li>Product naming conventions could not be altered</li><li>Product photography was limited with no budget to commission more</li><li>Timescales were extremely tight</li></ul><p>Whilst these constraints would potentially limit the success of the project, it did leave room to make some quick wins in other areas. </p></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2>Finding the problems</h2><p>Desk research revealed very quickly that the existing site was almost impossible to use for DIY customers. The following things contributed to that:</p><h3>The old site was split across 3 sections</h3><p>The sections were titled 'for everyone', 'for professionals' and 'for industry', the idea being that those sections had content specific to those user groups, but with some products shared between them.</p><p>The problem with this was that, as a DIY customer on the section titled 'for everyone', you could click on a product that would take you to the 'for professionals' section with no apparent reason. Suddenly all prices excluded tax and the terminology used was more technical. As an online experience it was pretty disorientating.</p><p>Additionally, this split made content management more of a headache with lots of duplicate content.</p><p>My proposal was to abolish this split and have a solution that was flexible enough to cater for everyone. A log in area for professional customers would take care of trade-specific pricing.</p><h3>Browsing colours was difficult</h3><p>Competitive analysis with successful paint brands in the UK gave us some insight to customer habits.</p><p>Most people buying paint were concerned primarily with colour, then finish, then specific surfaces like wood or masonry.</p><p>The old Tikkurila site was backwards, in that it prioritised their specialist products for certain finishes and surfaces. The user, having selected a product, would then have to use a clunky colour picker to get the right shade.</p><p>We would focus on reversing this to prioritise colour.</p><h3>Inspirational content was poor</h3><p>Other sites have a good range of articles and guides for exploring colours, trends and techniques. Whilst the old Tikkurila site made a small effort in this regard, broader and more visual content was required for it to be consiered inspiring.</p></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/tikkurila/old-site-details.png" alt="Some detail of the complicated old site, including 3-way site split and bewildering colour choice." /></figure></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2>Deciding what to fix</h2><p>A remote workshop allowed me to take the client through some analysis of their old site, and compare it to the sites of some competitors.</p><p>I used a Miro board to show direct comparisons, introduce the outcomes of our desk research, and capture thoughts and suggestions which would be useful later on.</p><p>The discussion which resulted was hugely beneficial, mainly to bring the client onboard with our thinking. Our shared vision was important to ensure the project had a minimum of design feedback, and timelines could be met.</p><p>During the workshop, the user researcher developed 4 user profiles to capture the main audience for the site. These were characterised as:</p><ul><li>First time home owner</li><li>Follower of colour trends</li><li>'Pro-sumer'</li><li>Professional decorator</li></ul></div></div><div class="block-single "><div class="block-single__container"><figure class="block-single__figure block-single__figure--narrow"><img class="block-single__image" src="/static/img/tikkurila/user-profiles.png" alt="A screenshot of the 4 user profiles used during our remote workship in Miro." /></figure></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2>Comparisons with the leading paint retailers</h2><p>A simple exercise was to capture the colour selection to add-to-cart journey of the main competitors, and directly compare it in a visual way to the Tikkurila site.</p><p>This way the client could see the problem clearly - that users weren't given the chance to explore colours in anywhere near enough detail to make a purchase decision.</p></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/tikkurila/comparisons.png" alt="Comparisons of key competitors colour to purchase journeys with side-by-side screenshots." /></figure></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2>My plan</h2><ul><li>Re-imagine the PDPs with what I know already</li><li>Work backwards from PDPs, covering PLPs and any other content types required for inspiration </li><li>Create a clickable prototype in Adobe XD for mobile, tablet, and desktop</li><li>Test with users, get feedback, and refine.</li><li>Regular design reviews with client, our SEO team, and wider project team.</li><li>Handover to external development team.</li></ul></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/tikkurila/add-to-cart-journey-old.png" alt="The add-to-cart journey of the old site shown in 5 mobile screenshots." /></figure></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2>A colour-first approach</h2><p>The old site (above) required users to find a paint amongst a bewildering array of Swedish-named specialist products, then select a colour with almost no indication of how the colour looks in real life.</p><p>I tackled this by treating colours like products, and allowing the colours their own space to breathe.</p><p>This allowed a more logical colour-first approach to shopping (below), where the user settles on a colour, can see the colour in-situ, choose a paint finish, choose a quantity of paint, and add to basket. </p></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/tikkurila/add-to-cart-journey-new.png" alt="The new product detail page, on mobile, showing the steps of a simplified add-to-cart journey." /></figure></div><div class="block-double block-double--image-right "><div class="block-double__container"><figure class="block-double__figure block-double__figure--phone"><img class="block-double__image" src="/static/img/tikkurila/paint-calculator.png" alt="The paint calculator shown on mobile." /></figure><div class="block-double__content"><div class="block-double__content-container"><h2 class="block-double__title"></h2><h2>A simple paint estimator</h2><p>How much paint do I need?
