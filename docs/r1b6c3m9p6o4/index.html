MPO started off as a solution for opening international accounts in response to our acquisition of HSBC Canada. But unexpectedly, what the business saw most value in wasnâ€™t just international accounts, it was the ability to open a whole package of accounts at once.</p><p>Since all our account open flows so far had been optimised around a single account, reinventing the experience around the idea of <i>a package of accounts</i> was an exciting unknown.</p><h3>Pick up a PoC and run with it</h3><p>I was asked to further explore the concept and deliver an MVP as lead interaction and visual designer, whilst partnering with a content designer who I worked alongside well into 2025.</p><ul class="list--sequence"><li><span>Late 2022</span>RBC announces purchase of HSBC Canada</li><li><span>Mid 2023</span>Design team forms a PoC for International Banking Package to align with HSBC products</li><li><span>Late 2023</span>Design and product teams expand scope to focus on Multi Product Onboarding</li><li><span>Early 2024</span>Design (and myself) given go ahead to develop an MVP for launch in 2025</li></ul><h3>Increase client retention</h3><p>Retention - the percentage of clients who stick around for at least 2 years - is only 50% for clients who have only one account. Adding a credit card boosts that number to 73%, and adding one or two engagement activities results in 85% and 99% respectively.  Simply put, clients with more products that properly fit their daily needs are much more likely to stay longer.</p><h3>Enhance the quality of new clients</h3><p>The overall goal of MPO is to onboard new clients in a way which helps them settle in with RBC. Accounts, investments, loans, credit cards, even mortgages...  Building that deep relationship from the start is the opportunity this hopes to unlock.</p></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2 class="chapter"><span>02</span><span>Exploring what form MPO should take</span></h2><p>There were some burning questions from the start, but I mainly wanted to know what clients would actually benefit from. Where is the sweet spot of 'upselling' that wouldn't alienate our single-product clients?</p><h3>How many accounts do clients want?</h3><p>According to 72% of multi-product interest clients, it's 2 or 3 accounts.</p><p>I decided to start off with the model of chequing account, savings account, and credit card, which describes the bank's 'ideal' client. We'd use this model going forward on which to base our design explorations, and eventually we'd add foreign currencies and US dollar to the mix.</p><h3>How much guidance do clients want?</h3><p>RBC offer 10 accounts within the chequing and savings categories, and the difference between them can be confusing. Some knowledgable clients know exactly which products they want, whilst others like to discuss their options with an advisor.</p><p><strong>I produced 2 initial concepts at different ends of this scale</strong>, exploring the possibilities between <i>passive</i> and <i>active</i> product recommendations.</p></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/mpo/active-passive.png" alt="The two early concepts used in generative research about user attitudes towards upselling."/><figcaption class="block-full__caption"><span>The two early concepts used in generative research about user attitudes towards upselling</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h3>The early discovery work gave us some critical knowledge</h3><p>These concepts were presented to would-be users to gather qualitative feedback via moderated tests. The outcome gave us a nuanced understanding of the 'sweet spot', which provided an early direction for the project.</p><ul><li>Users like <strong>being recommended specific products</strong>, not just types of product. For example, the <i>'High Interest eSavings'</i> instead of just <i>'a savings account'</i>.</li><li>Users like to <strong>see all of their options</strong>, not just our recommendation. So alongside the best product, an easy way to see the other products within that category.</li><li>Users want to <strong>provide their actual banking needs to inform recommendations</strong>, instead of us using their age and client segment to make sweeping generalisations. A tag with the label 'popular' wouldn't cut it.</li></ul><h3>The next iteration would have to be more conversational</h3><p>The main idea was to follow the same structure of conversation a client would have with an advisor. That meant:</p><ul><li>Knowing their basic information like name, age, and whether they're a student or new to Canada</li><li>Listening to the client explain their specific banking needs</li><li>Allowing the client the opportunity to open more accounts, whilst seeing all the options, but respect their preference to stick to just one</li></ul></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/mpo/conversation-flow.png" alt="Diagram showing flow of conversation moving through client basic info (with name, contact, and segment), banking needs, product review and selection, and onto the of the flow."/><figcaption class="block-full__caption"><span>Some conversational additions to the existing account open flow</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h3>Adapting our current account open experience</h3><p>Our solution had to fit into the current user flow on the RBC public website. Over a few weeks a solution began to take shape, weaving in new screens and adjusting existing ones in a way that fit within our technical architecture. </p><p>I focussed on a flow which:</p><ul><li>Learns as much as possible about the client upfront</li><li>Allows clients to choose between having a product-fit conversation, or 'skipping' with just one product</li><li>Presents product recommendations in context to their original selection, while offering 'skip' clients the same ability to freely explore and add products</li></ul></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2 class="chapter"><span>03</span><span>Getting buy-in from across the bank</span></h2><p>As expected with a project as large as this, it would require the input of many teams, in charge of different digital channels, to produce a cohesive solution. Some of these teams would have to be sold the idea.</p><h3>An experience map to show the problem</h3><p>I produced a map for our entire current-state experience, across multiple flows and digital platforms, to show how convoluted the current experience could be for a multi-product client.</p><p>Then I produced a map for the future experience, to compare to current-state, and demonstrate the potential impact our work could have for our clients and their perception of RBC.</p><p>My approach involved:</p><ul><li>Finding as much existing shared research as possible that's still relevant, plus data from GA, and applying it to the map.</li><li>Reaching out to researchers and designers across the bank to gather insights fron their research activities.</li><li>Using knowledge from our ongoing research MPO studies.</li><li>Roughly visualising each 'step' with user sentiments for easy shareouts.</li></ul><p><strong>The map worked as intended</strong>, and showed how much time we'd save a large number of our new clients.</p></div></div><div class="block-single "><div class="block-single__container"><figure class="block-single__figure "><img class="block-single__image" src="/static/img/mpo/experience-map-1.jpg" alt="A short snippet of the experience map I produced"/><figcaption class="block-single__caption"><span>A short snippet of the experience map</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="block-double block-double--image-left "><div class="block-double__container"><figure class="block-double__figure "><img class="block-double__image" src="/static/img/mpo/experience-map-2.jpg" alt="A zoomed out view of the full experience map including sections covering 3 channels"/></figure><div class="block-double__content"><div class="block-double__content-container"><h3 class="block-double__title">Take it further</h3><p>Soon I was asked by our director to extend this activity for another purpose - to kick off a week-long design sprint. For that I connected with design leads from other departments to get their direct input, and checked in periodically to provide guidance where needed.</p><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h3>Folding in our experience vision principles</h3><p>Whilst mapping our journeys the team also agreed upon an experience vision, with basic principles that could be applied to our decision making. But this initiative was somewhat detached from the other design activities the team were doing.</p><p><strong>I sought to fix that</strong> by starting with the journey map and pain points, bringing in the latest research findings, and aligning each finding with the relevant principle from that experience vision. This was put in a diagram that could be used to produce actionable user stories, which stay true to that experience vision.</p></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/mpo/experience-vision.png" alt="Diagram showing the bringing together of known pain points, fresh research findings, and our experience vision principles."/><figcaption class="block-full__caption"><span>Linking known pain points, fresh research findings, and our experience vision principles.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="block-double block-double--image-right "><div class="block-double__container"><figure class="block-double__figure block-double__figure--small"><img class="block-double__image" src="/static/img/mpo/another-one.jpg" alt="Short snippet of an email promoting our project, featuring DJ Khaled."/></figure><div class="block-double__content"><div class="block-double__content-container"><h3 class="block-double__title">Increasing visibility of the project</h3><p>As the project went on throughout 2024 it became clear that MPO was an extremely popular subject for many teams within the bank.</p><p>My role became as much about protecting the original vision, as it was about engaging with stakeholders and socialising the initiative. Typically this involved some compromise, in part due to complex technical architecture, but also because the bank is subject to strict Canadian financial regulations.</p><p></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h3>The account open flow would need re-engineered</h3><p>The 'sales rail', the flow of screens by which we collect client information, is a linear and rigid series of forms within a single page app (SPA). They were completely different between channels, so I helped start the conversations with our tech and product partners which would be required to embark on a technical overhaul.</p><p>Much of the early work involved creating diagrams whilst having conversations with other design partners. With a diagram, I could map out our ideal account open flow and communicate how the technical implementation of our existing flow would have to change to accommodate it.</p><p><strong>I created this particular diagram to communicate the high-level effort required for each release.</strong> Our product and tech partners found this useful for writing stories and knowing where to focus their attention next.</p></div></div><div class="block-double "><div class="block-double__container"><figure class="block-double__figure "><img class="block-double__image" src="/static/img/mpo/phasing-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing releases 0 to 4, and the incremental effort required at each release."/></figure><figure class="block-double__figure block-double__figure--small"><img class="block-double__image" src="/static/img/mpo/phasing-4.jpg" alt="Legend for the diagram showing top to bottom: Adaptations not fundamental to MPO, new and required for MPO Core, new and required for MPO Enhanced, and lastly, new and required for MPO enhanced with credit cards."/></figure></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h3>Planning our updates within a busy team</h3><p>One of the key takeaways was orchestrating our planned user flow updates amongst a flurry of releases from roughly 10 squads.</p><p>Sharing the work at refinement sessions, and adapting our plan where necessary, were both crucial to make sure the journey's releases formed a cohesive whole.</p></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h2 class="chapter"><span>04</span><span>The nitty gritty</span></h2><h3>Catering to two types of client</h3><p>The point where we offer the client the opportunity to discuss banking needs for other products, was under a lot of scrutiny. On the one hand, we should encourage clients to share some financial needs to achieve maximum efficiency of funds. On the other hand, some clients are simply not interested in that, and those people are just as important.</p><p>This 'banking needs' screen went through countless iterations, framing our question in different ways to draw in multi-product clients without upsetting single-product clients. </p></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/mpo/skip-all.jpg" alt="7 photos showing a phone with 7 different versions of the banking needs screen, with subtle differences in content and ways of asking the question."/><figcaption class="block-full__caption"><span>Some of the iterations of content and question angling</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h3>Creating rudimentary UI components to work with</h3><p>MPO had user needs that no other RBC product had, therefore a new set of UI components would be made to support them.</p><p>I used RBC's design system to create this UI, which provided a basis for our prototyping and iteration. Fonts, text sizes, text weights, colours, buttons, and pills were provided to maintain consistency with other RBC experiences.</p><p>Whilst consistent, it can't be ignored that RBC's design language lends the UI a utilitarian feel.</p></div></div><div class="block-double block-double--image-left "><div class="block-double__container"><figure class="block-double__figure block-double__figure--small block-double__figure--phone"><img class="block-double__image" src="/static/img/mpo/drawer-layers.gif" alt="GIF showing a sped-up demonstration of the prototype, exploring the 4 layers of off-canvas product exploration."/></figure><div class="block-double__content"><div class="block-double__content-container"><h3 class="block-double__title">Off-canvas product exploration</h3><p>Users expressed concern that if they chose to explore and add other products, it would take them away from their spot in the flow</p><p>I chose to adapt an existing UI component to house menus for categories, individual products, and detail views for each product. This pattern would also afford us the luxury of adding more guidance content when required, such as offers and product nuances that would come up in conversation with an advisor.</p><p></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-content"><div class="block-content__container"><h3>The product comparison card</h3><p>We asked users what features they prioritised when making a decision to move forwad with an account.</p><p>For a chequing account, 69.4% of users said <i>monthly fee</i> was most important aspect to compare. But for a savings account, 61.1% said that <i>interest rate</i> was deemed the most important.</p><p>Interestingly, promotions were considered the least important aspect. However, two things led to the design below: consistency with how promotions are treated on our marketing site, and a strong interest from our product team who wanted to highlight short-term offers more effectively. Despite going against the grain of the data, the selection card tested very well in subsequent tests.</p></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/mpo/card-breakdown.png" alt="Diagram and close-up showing the breakdown of the product selection card.

It consists of a blue section dedicated to exploring and adding other products, and a white section focussed on their selections in the fashion of a cart. The user would get to this screen, either having answered some questions about their banking needs, or skipping that with just one product.</p><p>For users who skipped, the screen offers a chance to browse and add anything else whilst reviewing their selections.

So providing an easy-to-follow singular path through all the complexity was my goal.</p><p>Our client would have just finished the account-open flow on their web browser. An existing feature outside my control was that, at the end and depending on their device, they'd be directed to Online Banking on desktop or the RBC Mobile app on mobile.</p><p>Their journey would probably look like:</p><ul class="list--sequence"><li>Copy their client number in the web browser, at the end of the flow</li><li>Follow a primary link to either the Online Banking portal in the browser, or RBC Mobile app on the app store</li><li>Log into these for the first time using their recently-copied client number</li><li>Access and familiarise with their Canadian accounts and profile</li><li>Follow links to enrol in the U.S. Online Banking, which can only happen in the browser</li><li>Access and familiarise with their U.S. accounts and profile</li><li>Follow links to connect both platorms and allow cross-border money transfers</li></ul></div></div><div class="block-full"><figure class="block-full__figure"><img class="block-full__image" src="/static/img/mpo/onboarding-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing the next steps for a cross-border Canadian and U.S. client.
